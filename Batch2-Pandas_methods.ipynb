We tried the butter beer , fiery fries, triple chicken pizza, Peri peri chicken burger and gnocchi from the newly launched menu . The butter beer , fries and pizza is a must try. The Gnocchi was blande n tasteless .The service was very bad , it took us too long for us to understand what he was talking .

Also, the guy making rotis maybe wasnt in, and so they werent serving any of their parathas that day.Anyways, we ordered Veg Chop, Egg Roll, Egg Curry and Bengali Fried rice.The chop was good, and had many veggies including beetroot in it.\\\\nThe egg curry was usual stuff, and nothing much to write about. The Bengali fried rice was a tad on the sweeter side, though it went well with the egg curry.\\\\nThe egg rolls, though was another story. Clearly the highlight of the meal for me, the rolls were soft, the filling was spicy and really well made.

It's not something inedible but it's not worth a recommendation as well. The fish chop was also average. You should really taste egg mughlai and fish chop from Kolkata. It will blow your mind and then you'll know the difference. And here I'm referring to roadside shops, completely unhygienic ones. I was thinking of ordering egg devil as well but I'm glad I didn't.\\\\n\\\\nDelivery was quick, I personally had no issues with the service.

I had been to bake addiction to order couple of speciality cakes for my daughter's birthday this month. Srobona and her team was fully dedicated and helped us choosing the best flavours available. We ordered a strawberry and a chocolate one both of them were really yummy. They uses butter cream instead of other toppings and the flavour was just awesome. Unlike other cakes we felt like eating more and more cakes and never got bored with it. They even delivered the cakes much earlier almost by 7 30 in the morning just as what they have committed. Kudos to Srobona and team. Would recommend bake addiction to all who are looking for varieties and definitely they are one of the best bakers in the town so far.. cheers!!\\\")]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

There is a very small area to sit and eat so better to opt for takeaway. They only serve chicken biriyani, kuska and kabab. Chicken biriyani at 70 rs is value for money cuz you get 2 /3 chicken pieces depending on the size. I also love their kababs (40 rs only for half plate) with around 5 small pieces but spicy and tasty.

By seeing the review. But expectations hurts..... What ever the spicy dishes they recommend was not as good as they suggested. The hyped butter beer... Was not so good as they suggested.

But it's of no spice ..only potato wedges were good enof.\\\\nFries which were served with burgers were also no properly salted .\\\\nHad so so mixed experience.\\\"), ('Rated 3.0', \\\"RATED\\\\n  A very less known wizard cafe in that vicinity . It's a complete wizard theme cafe , will definitely recommend if you are a Harry potter fan . They have quirky interiors n a photo booth with wizard hats, cloacks, wands , brooms. The option on the menu are limited . They were reintroducing there menu which had a lil more options than the previous one wen we visited . We tried the butter beer , fiery fries, triple chicken pizza, Peri peri chicken burger and gnocchi from the newly launched menu . The butter beer , fries and pizza is a must try. The Gnocchi was blande n tasteless .The service was very bad , it took us too long for us to understand what he was talking . We asked for suggestions on the food but he started with his pointless conversation which was really hard to digest . We time n again had to call the owner n talk to her . She was a sweet lady .worth a mention though.\\\"), ('Rated 3.0', \\\"RATED\\\\n  The ambiance over here is 3.5/5... Didn't live up to my expectations...
